(1)
Type: unreadVariable.
What: Variable 'tmpDevice' is assigned a value that is never used.
Where: DeviceVerwalter.cpp.
Solution: Remove the tmpDevice variable.

(2)
Type: cstyleCast.
What: C-style pointer casting detected.
      C++ offers four different kinds of casts as replacements: static_cast, const_cast,
      dynamic_cast and reinterpret_cast.
      A C-style cast could evaluate to any of those automatically,
      thus it is considered safer if the programmer explicitly states which kind of cast is expected.
Where: DeviceVerwalter.cpp.
Solution: Use dynamic_cast for derived class.

(3)
Type: noCopyConstructor
What: The class 'CocktailPro' does not have a copy constructor
      which is recommended since the class contains a pointer to allocated memory.
Where: CocktailPro.h.
Solution: Implement a copy constructor.

(4), (5), (6)
Type: unsafeClassCanLeak.
What: The class 'CocktailPro' is unsafe, wrong usage can cause memory/resource leaks for
      'CocktailPro::barTender'.
      This can for instance be fixed by adding proper cleanup in the destructor.
Where: CocktailPro.h.
Solution: Implement a destructor.

(7)
Type: knownConditionTrueFalse.
What: Condition 'CocktailNo>=0' is always true.
Where: CocktailPro.cpp.
Solution: Remove the condition 'CocktailNo>=0'.

(8)
Type: copyCtorAndEqOperator.
What: The class 'CocktailPro' has 'copy constructor' but lack of 'operator='.
Where: CocktailPro.h
Solution: Implement an assigment operator for the CocktailPro class.

(9)
Type: noCopyConstructor
What: class 'AvailableIngredients' does not have a copy constructor
      which is recommended since the class contains a pointer to allocated memory.
Where: AvailableIngredients.h
Solution: Implement a copy constructor.

(10)
Type: unusedPrivateFunction
What: Unused private function: 'AvailableIngredients::DummyZutatenEinfuegen'
Where: AvailableIngredients.h
Solution: Comment out the function 'DummyZutataenEinfuegen' for future test purpose.

(11)
Type: postfixOperator
What: Prefer prefix ++/-- operators for non-primitive types.. Prefix ++/-- operators should be preferred for non-primitive types.
      Pre-increment/decrement can be more efficient than post-increment/decrement.
      Post-increment/decrement usually involves keeping a copy of the previous value around and adds a little extra code.
Where: BarTender.cpp
Solution: Implement prefix ++ operator for "i1".

(12)
Type: noExplicitConstructor
What: Class 'BarTender' has a constructor with 1 argument that is not explicit. Such constructors should in general be explicit for type safety reasons.
      Using the explicit keyword in the constructor means some mistakes when using the class can be avoided.
Where: BarTender.h
Solution: Add keyword "explicit" in front of constructor in header file.

(13)
Type: useInitializationList
What: Variable 'm_Zutat' is assigned in constructor body. Consider performing initialization in initialization list..
      When an object of a class is created, the constructors of all member variables are called consecutively in the order the variables are declared, even if you don't explicitly write them to the initialization list.
      You could avoid assigning 'm_Zutat' a value by passing the value to the constructor in the initialization list.
Where: RecipeStep.cpp
Solution: Initialize the attributes using a initialization list.

(14)
Type: passedByValue
What: Function parameter 'inputZutat' should be passed by reference.. Parameter 'inputZutat' is passed by value.
      It could be passed as a (const) reference which is usually faster and recommended in C++.
Where: RecipeStep.cpp
Solution: Change function parameter 'inputZutat' to be passed by (const) reference.

(15)
Type: unusedFunction
What: The function 'detach' is never used.
Where: Subject.cpp
Solution: Implement a destructor for each 'Dispenser' class and 'Drainer' class.
          Place 'detach' function in each of the destructor.

(16)
Type: noConstructor
What: The class 'Waage' does not have a constructor.. The class 'Waage' does not have a constructor although it has private member variables.
      Member variables of builtin types are left uninitialized when the class is instantiated. That may cause bugs or undefined behavior.
Where: Waage.h
Solution: Implement constructor and initialize the variables 'weight' and 'deltaweight'.

(17)
Type: uninitMemberVar
What: Member variable 'AvailableIngredients::anzahlDosierer' is not initialized in the constructor.
Where: AvailableIngredients.cpp
Solution: Commented out if-else statement within the constructor so that function 'ZutatenDateiEinlesen("zutaten.txt")' is executable.
          The line of code 'anzahlDosierer = zutaten->size()' is executable and variable anzahlDosierer is initialized.

(18)
Type: copyCtorAndEqOperator
What: The class 'AvailableIngredients' has 'copy constructor' but lack of 'operator='.
Where: AvailableIngredients.h
Solution: Implement an assignment operator

(19)
Type: operatorEqToSelf
What: 'operator=' should check for assignment to self to avoid problems with dynamic memory..
      'operator=' should check for assignment to self to ensure that each block of dynamically allocated memory is owned and managed by only one instance of the class.
Where: AvailableIngredients.cpp
Solution: Implement an explicit self check for the assignment operator.

(20)
Type: noExplicitConstructor
What: Single-argument constructors must be marked explicit to avoid unintentional implicit conversions.
Where: MixableRecipeBook.h
Solution: Use the keyword 'explicit' before to avoid using a default constructor.

(21)
Type: uninitMemberVar
What: Member variable 'InternalDevice::zeiteinheit' is not initialized in the constructor.
Where: InternalDevice.cpp
Solution: Added variable 'zeiteinheit' to constructor and initialized with 0.

(22)
Type: unusedFunction
What: The function 'setTimer' is never used.
Where: InternalDevice.cpp
Solution: Delete empty declaration of function 'setTimer' from the 'InternalDevice.cpp'.

(23)
Type: useInitializationList
What: Variable 'inhalt' is assigned in constructor body.
      Consider performing initialization in initialization list..
      When an object of a class is created,
      the constructors of all member variables are called consecutively in the order the variables are declared,
      even if you don't explicitly write them to the initialization list.
Where: Dispenser.cpp
Solution: Initial the variable 'inhalt' in the initialization list and no more in the body of constructor.

(24)
Type: passedByValue
What: Function parameter 'inhaltParameter' should be passed by reference..
      Parameter 'inhaltParameter' is passed by value.
      It could be passed as a (const) reference which is usually faster and recommended in C++.
Where: Dispenser.cpp
Solution: Changed the parameter 'std::string inhaltParameter' in the constructor to 'const std::string & inhaltParameter'.
          Now it is a const reference of the parameter.

(25)
Type: noExplicitConstructor
What: Single-argument constructors must be marked explicit to avoid unintentional implicit conversions.
Where: DeviceVerwalter.h
Solution: Use the keyword 'explicit' before to avoid using a default constructor.
