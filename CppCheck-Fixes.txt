(1)
Type: unreadVariable.
What: Variable 'tmpDevice' is assigned a value that is never used.
Where: DeviceVerwalter.cpp.
Solution: Remove the tmpDevice variable.

(2)
Type: cstyleCast.
What: C-style pointer casting detected.
      C++ offers four different kinds of casts as replacements: static_cast, const_cast,
      dynamic_cast and reinterpret_cast.
      A C-style cast could evaluate to any of those automatically,
      thus it is considered safer if the programmer explicitly states which kind of cast is expected.
Where: DeviceVerwalter.cpp.
Solution: Use dynamic_cast for derived class.

(3)
Type: noCopyConstructor
What: The class 'CocktailPro' does not have a copy constructor
      which is recommended since the class contains a pointer to allocated memory.
Where: CocktailPro.h.
Solution: Implement a copy constructor.

(4), (5), (6)
Type: unsafeClassCanLeak.
What: The class 'CocktailPro' is unsafe, wrong usage can cause memory/resource leaks for
      'CocktailPro::theCocktailZubereiter'.
      This can for instance be fixed by adding proper cleanup in the destructor.
Where: CocktailPro.h.
Solution: Implement a destructor.
