(1)
Type: unreadVariable
What: Variable 'tmpDevice' is assigned a value that is never used.
Where: DeviceVerwalter.cpp
Solution: remove the tmpDevice variable.

(2)
Type: cstyleCast
What: C-style pointer casting detected.
      C++ offers four different kinds of casts as replacements: static_cast, const_cast,
      dynamic_cast and reinterpret_cast.
      A C-style cast could evaluate to any of those automatically,
      thus it is considered safer if the programmer explicitly states which kind of cast is expected.
Where: DeviceVerwalter.cpp
Solution: use dynamic_cast for derived class.
